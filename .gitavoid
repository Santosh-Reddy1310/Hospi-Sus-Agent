# .gitavoid - guidance file (informational only)

# This repository uses a .gitignore to avoid committing local environment files
# and secrets. For your convenience, include this file so contributors know to
# avoid committing sensitive files.

# Do NOT commit the following files/values:
# - .env (contains API keys such as GROQ_API_KEY)
# - data/long_term_memory.json (may contain sensitive outputs)
# - logs/ or outputs/

# To safely set your Groq API key locally (Windows cmd):
# setx GROQ_API_KEY "<your_key_here>"
# Then reopen your terminal to pick up the variable.

# For session-only (temporary) variables in current cmd session:
# set GROQ_API_KEY=<your_key_here>

# On Linux/macOS (bash):
# export GROQ_API_KEY="<your_key_here>"

# NEVER paste API keys into code or commit them to source control.
